                and worked for 5 years before opening 'Bimisenryu Tanka', a modern Japanese restaurant in 2004. In 2005,Ramen
                has much more free space to be innovative and creative compared to other cuisines thus he came up with different
                approaches to create recipes for ramen that nobody else has tried and tasted before. His first ramen restaurant
                is called 'Kuro Miso Ramen.The First Generation Keisuke Ramen). The ingredients were mixed Miso base with
                7 different types of Miso and Bamboo Charcoal.
